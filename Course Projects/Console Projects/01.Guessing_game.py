# Completing the Project
# -----------------------

# Your task is to extend and complete the number guessing game. Follow these steps to finish the project:

# 1. START a loop that continues until the user guesses the correct number.
# 2. ASK the user to enter their guess.
# 3. CHECK if the user's input is a valid number.
# 4. COMPARE the user's guess to the randomly generated number we generated in line 4.
# 5. KEEP TRACK of the number of guesses the user makes.
# 6. PRINT the GUESS result based on whether the user guessed correctly in one attempt or took multiple attempts.



# Enjoy the coding journey!
